# Monochrome (Retro) Gaming Logos submissions folder

If you'd like to submit a logo, please make sure it's a vector-based design - it can be in any format (SVG, EPS or AI for example). You can submit in a couple of ways - create an issue and post a link to the file(s) or fork this repo and add your design(s) to the submissions folder and issue a pull request. Please don't submit PNG or other bitmap files - I generate PNGs automatically from the vector paths.
