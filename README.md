# Monochrome (Retro) Gaming Logos

[![CC BY-SA 4.0][cc-by-sa-shield]][cc-by-sa]


Logos (primarily) for [Pegasus Frontend](https://pegasus-frontend.org/) themes, including [GameOS](https://github.com/PlayingKarrde/gameOS) - you can also use them for any project or front-end where you want monochrome logos.

The collection includes arcade, console, computer, publisher, category and custom playlist logos - its goal is comprehensive coverage of all the usual (and some unusual) emulated systems/platforms.

These logos are a work of artistic expression on my part and recreations made under a fair-use principle, they're all provided as-is. Use them freely in your collections or projects, I only ask that you include a link back to this repository if distributing any of them with your work. If you plan to include any in a commercial project, be aware that while the license for this repository allows free use (aka copy-left), some of the designs (non-simple letters) may be covered by an original copyright and many of the designs are trademarked by their brand owners. You've been informed, and I'm not taking responsibility for any issues that may arise from your use of the marks. 

### Requests

Do you feel a logo is missing, have an idea for an alternate or have another special request? Create an issue and let me know.

### Submissions

If you'd like to submit a logo, please make sure it's a vector-based design - it can be in any format (SVG, EPS or AI for example). You can submit in a couple of ways - create an issue and post a link to the file(s) or fork this repo and add your design(s) to the submissions folder and issue a pull request. Please don't submit PNG or other bitmap files - I generate PNGs automatically from the vector paths.

### Specifications

PNG files are 600 pixels wide.  SVG files 2 inches @ 300dpi. If you need larger PNG files, download the SVG and resize, or simply increase the DPI, then export a new PNG.

All PNG and SVG files have been passed through an optimizer to reduce their filesize and maintain 100% compatibility.
