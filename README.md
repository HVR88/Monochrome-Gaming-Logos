# Monochrome (Retro) Gaming Logos

[![CC BY-SA 4.0][cc-by-sa-shield]][cc-by-sa]


Logos (primarily) for [Pegasus Frontend](https://pegasus-frontend.org/) themes, including [GameOS](https://github.com/PlayingKarrde/gameOS) - you can of course use them for any project or front-end where you want monochrome logos.

The collection includes arcade, console, computer, publisher and category/playlist logos.

What makes this collection different than others out there? In addition to all the original custom artwork not seen anywhere else, this collection strives to be more complete than any other. All the corporate logos here are accurate and many have been created from scratch, either using the correct base font or hand-drawn to match the original. Simply put, you won't be able to source this collection anywhere else.

You can do pretty much whataver you want with the logos here, but I ask that you include a link back to this repository if distributing any of them with your work. These logos are a work of artistic expression on my part and provided as-is. If you plan to include any in a commercial project, be aware that while my recreations' copyright allows free use (aka copy-left), many of the designs are trademarked by their brand owners - so you've been informed, and I'm not taking responsibility for any issues that may arise from your use of the marks. 

### Requests

Do you feel a logo is missing, have an idea for an alternate or have another special request? Create an issue and let me know.

### Submissions

If you'd like to submit a logo, please make sure it's a vector-based design - it can be in any format (SVG, EPS or AI for example). You can submit in a couple of ways - create an issue and post a link to the file(s) or fork this repo and add your design(s) to the submissions folder and issue a pull request. Please don't submit PNG or other bitmap files - I generate PNGs automatically from the vector paths.

### Specifications

Collection PNG files are all 600 pixels wide.  SVG files 2 inches @ 300dpi. If you need larger PNG files, download the SVG and resize, or simply increase the DPI, then export a new PNG.

All PNG and SVG files have been passed through an optimizer to reduce their filesize and maintain 100% compatibility.
