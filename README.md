Logos (primarily) for [Pegasus Frontend](https://pegasus-frontend.org/) themes, including [GameOS](https://github.com/PlayingKarrde/gameOS) - you can also use them for any project or front-end where you want monochrome logos.

The collection includes arcade, console, computer, publisher, category and playlist logos - its goal is comprehensive coverage of all the usual (and some unusual) emulated systems/platforms.

These logos are a work of artistic expression on my part and recreations made under a fair-use principle, they're all provided as-is. Use them freely in your collections or projects, I only ask that you include a link back to this repository if distributing them with your work. 

Be aware some of the designs may be covered by original copyright and many of the designs are trademarked by their brand owners. You've been informed, and I take no responsibility for any issues that may arise from your use of the files/works. 

### Requests

Do you feel a logo is missing, have an idea for an alternate or have a special request? Create an issue and let me know.

### Submissions

If you'd like to submit a logo, please make sure it's a vector-based design (SVG, EPS or AI). Submit in one of two ways:
- Create an issue and post a link to the file(s)
- Fork this repo and add your design(s) to the submissions folder, then issue a pull request.

Please don't submit PNG or other bitmap files - PNGs will be generated from the vector files.

### Specifications

SVG files are 2 inches wide @ 300dpi and PNG files 600 pixels wide. If you need larger PNG files, download the SVG and resize or increase the DPI, then export a new PNG.

All PNG and SVG files have been passed through an optimizer to reduce their filesize and maintain compatibility with Pegasus Frontend.
