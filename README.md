# Monochrome (Retro) Gaming Logos

[![CC BY-SA 4.0][cc-by-sa-shield]][cc-by-sa]


Logos for [Pegasus Frontend](https://pegasus-frontend.org/) themes, including [GameOS](https://github.com/PlayingKarrde/gameOS)

Includes arcade, console, computer, publisher and category/playlist logos.

What makes these logos different than others out there? This collection is more complete than any other I know of, but more importantly, all the corporate logos here are accurate. Many have been created from scratch, either using the correct base font or hand-drawn to match the original. 

You can do pretty much whataver you want with the logos here, but I ask that you include a link back to this repository if distributing any of them with your work. These logos are a work of artistic expression on my part and provided as-is. If you plan to include any in a commercial project, be aware that while my recreations' copyright allow free use (aka copy-left), many of the designs are trademarked by their brand owners - so you've been informed, and I'm not taking responsibility for any issues that may arise from your use of the marks. 

Do you feel a logo is missing, have an idea for an alternate or have another special request? Create an issue and let me know.

PNG files are all 600 pixels wide.  SVG files 2 inches @ 300dpi. If you need larger PNG files, download the SVG and resize, or simply increase the DPI, then export a new PNG.
