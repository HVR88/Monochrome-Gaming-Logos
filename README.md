# Monochrome (Retro) Gaming Logos

[![CC BY-SA 4.0][cc-by-sa-shield]][cc-by-sa]

Logos for [Pegasus Frontend](https://pegasus-frontend.org/), including [GameOS](https://github.com/PlayingKarrde/gameOS) theme - you can also use them for other  front-ends such as Emulation Station, LaunchBox/BigBox, Attract Mode, or any other project where you want monochrome logos.

The collection includes arcade, console, computer, publisher, category and playlist logos - comprehensive coverage of the usual (and some unusual) emulated systems/platforms. 

There are currently over 600 designs and variations in the collection.

Sample collages:

Some of the designs are covered by original copyright and many of the designs are trademarked by their brand owners. These recreations are works of artistic expression  under a fair-use principle and provided as-is. Use them freely in your collections or projects, I only ask that you include a link back to this repository if distributing them with your work. I take no responsibility for any issues that may arise from anyone else's use or misuse of these works. 

### Requests

Is there an important logo missing from the collection, do you have an idea for an alternate or have a special request? Let me know by opening a new issue.

### Submissions

Make sure the design is 100% vector-based (SVG, EPS or AI) without any rasterized or bitmap elements - also not a poor automated trace with excessive nodes/anchors. Submit files in one of two ways:
- Open a new issue and post a link to the file(s)
- Fork the repo and add your design(s) to the submissions folder, then issue a pull request.

Please don't submit any bitmap files - PNGs will be generated from the vector files. If you need to submit multi-color vectors, I can create a monochrome version.

### Specifications

SVG files are 2 inches wide @ 300dpi and PNG files 600 pixels wide. If you need larger PNG files, download the SVG and resize or increase the DPI, then export a new PNG.

The files have all been passed through an optimizer to reduce their size and maintain compatibility with Pegasus Frontend.

### Background and a Special Request

I originally started working on these logos to shore up missing artwork from [Pegasus Frontend](https://pegasus-frontend.org/), as I'm a big fan and would very much like to see it succeed. While I'm a regular donnor on Patreon, I'm not able to offer very much financially, so it's my hope that I can additionally contribute in other ways, through testing and now by providing more artwork, giving users more options for their collections.

If you value this work, I'd like to make the smallest request. Please visit the [Pegasus Frontend](https://pegasus-frontend.org/) project, try it out on your platform of choice and if you're able, make a small contribution in some way. Consider financial assistance to its author, contributing code to the project or spreading the word and letting your friends or subscribers know about it. 

Don't forget to also check out the [GameOS](https://github.com/PlayingKarrde/gameOS) theme, it provides one of the best and most polished front-end experiences for large game libraries.
