# Monochrome (Retro) Gaming Logos

The collection includes arcade, console, computer, publisher, category and playlist logos - comprehensive coverage of the usual, and some unusual, systems/platforms available for emulation.

I originally started working on these to add missing artwork to [Pegasus Frontend](https://pegasus-frontend.org/) and [GameOS](https://github.com/PlayingKarrde/gameOS) theme, as I'm a big fan and would very much like to see both succeed. While I'm a regular donnor on Patreon, I'm not able to offer very much financially, so it's my hope that I can additionally contribute in other ways, through testing and now by providing more artwork, giving users more options for their collections.

If you value this work, I'd like to make the smallest request. Please visit the [Pegasus Frontend](https://pegasus-frontend.org/) project and [GameOS](https://github.com/PlayingKarrde/gameOS), try them on your platform of choice and if you're able, make a small contribution in some way. Consider financial assistance to the authors, contributing code to the projects or spreading the word and letting your friends or subscribers know about them. 

*There are over 620 designs and variations in the collection.*

You can also these logos for other front-ends such as Emulation Station, LaunchBox/BigBox, Attract Mode, or any other project or design where you want monochrome logos.

### Usage Disclaimer

While this collection includes many of my original designs, some images are covered by third-party copyrights and many are trade or service marks of their brand owners. The specific recreations hosted here are works of artistic expression, made under a fair-use principle and provided as-is for identification purposes, without any claimed affiliation or endorsement from any rights holders. Use them freely in your collections or projects and please include a note and link back to this repository to help maintain the collection and realize future edits.

Be aware that there may be restrictions with respect to inclusion of some logos/marks in commercial projects. I take no responsibility for any issues that may arise from anyone else's use or misuse of these images. 

### Requests

Let me know by opening a new issue if there's anything important missing, you have an idea for an alternate or have any special requests.

### Submissions

Make sure designs are vector-based (SVG, EPS or AI) without any rasterized or bitmap elements, and also not automated traces with excessive nodes/anchors or rough curves. Submit files in one of two ways:
- Open a new issue and post a link to the file(s)
- Fork the repo and add your design(s) to the submissions folder, then issue a pull request.

Please don't submit bitmap files - PNGs will be generated from the vector files. If you need to submit multi-color vectors, I can create monochrome versions.

### Specifications

**File Sizes:** SVG files are 2 inches wide @ 300dpi and PNG files 600 pixels wide. If you need larger PNG files, download the SVG and resize or increase the DPI, then export a new pixel-perfect PNG.

*The files have been passed through an optimizer to reduce file sizes, maintain quality, and increase compatibility.*

**Filenames:** Files are named in lowercase with words separated by an underscore. In the case of consoles and computers, names start with the manufacturer/brand name, followed by the product/model name. Example: *nintendo_gameboy_color.svg*. 

Playlist and category-type logos all start with the *playlist_* prefix.

When there are alternative files for any logo, an additional suffix such as *_outline*, *_flat*, *_alt* or other variation is added to the base name.

You may have to rename files or modify platform/playlist names in your theme or configurations to make them match.
