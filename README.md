# Monochrome (Retro) Gaming Logos

[![CC BY-SA 4.0][cc-by-sa-shield]][cc-by-sa]

Logos (primarily) for [Pegasus Frontend](https://pegasus-frontend.org/) themes, including [GameOS](https://github.com/PlayingKarrde/gameOS) - you can also use them for other themes and front-ends such as Emulation Station, LaunchBox/BigBox, Attract Mode, or any other project where you want monochrome logos.

The collection includes arcade, console, computer, publisher, category and playlist logos - its goal is comprehensive coverage of all the usual (and some unusual) emulated systems/platforms. 

Artwork files: 578

Sample collages:

These logos are provided as-is, are works of artistic expression on my part and recreations are made under a fair-use principle. Use them freely in your collections or projects, I only ask that you include a link back to this repository if distributing them with your work. 

Some of the designs are covered by original copyright and many of the designs are trademarked by their brand owners. I take no responsibility for any issues that may arise from anyone else's use of these files/works. 

### Requests

Do you think a logo is missing, have an idea for an alternate or have a special request? Let me know by opening a new issue.

### Submissions

Make sure the design is vector-based (SVG, EPS or AI), not a poor automated trace, and submit in one of two ways:
- Open a new issue and post a link to the file(s)
- Fork the repo and add your design(s) to the submissions folder, then issue a pull request.

Please don't submit PNG or other bitmap files - PNGs will be generated from the vector files. If you need to submit multi-color vectors, I can take care of the monochrome interpretation when I have time.

### Specifications

SVG files are 2 inches wide @ 300dpi and PNG files 600 pixels wide. If you need larger PNG files, download the SVG and resize or increase the DPI, then export a new PNG.

All PNG and SVG files have been passed through an optimizer to reduce their filesize and maintain compatibility with Pegasus Frontend.
