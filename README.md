# Monochrome (Retro) Gaming Logos

[![CC BY-SA 4.0][cc-by-sa-shield]][cc-by-sa]


Logos (primarily) for [Pegasus Frontend](https://pegasus-frontend.org/) themes, including [GameOS](https://github.com/PlayingKarrde/gameOS) - you can also use them for any project or front-end where you want monochrome logos.

The collection includes arcade, console, computer, publisher, category and custom playlist logos - its goal is comprehensive coverage of all the usual (and some unusual) emulated systems/platforms.

You can do pretty much whataver you want with the logos here, but I ask that you include a link back to this repository if distributing any of them with your work. These logos are a work of artistic expression on my part and provided as-is. If you plan to include any in a commercial project, be aware that while my recreations' copyright allows free use (aka copy-left), many of the designs are trademarked by their brand owners - so you've been informed, and I'm not taking responsibility for any issues that may arise from your use of the marks. 

### Requests

Do you feel a logo is missing, have an idea for an alternate or have another special request? Create an issue and let me know.

### Submissions

If you'd like to submit a logo, please make sure it's a vector-based design - it can be in any format (SVG, EPS or AI for example). You can submit in a couple of ways - create an issue and post a link to the file(s) or fork this repo and add your design(s) to the submissions folder and issue a pull request. Please don't submit PNG or other bitmap files - I generate PNGs automatically from the vector paths.

### Specifications

Collection PNG files are all 600 pixels wide.  SVG files 2 inches @ 300dpi. If you need larger PNG files, download the SVG and resize, or simply increase the DPI, then export a new PNG.

All PNG and SVG files have been passed through an optimizer to reduce their filesize and maintain 100% compatibility.
