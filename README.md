# Monochrome (Retro) Gaming Logos

Logos for [Pegasus Frontend](https://pegasus-frontend.org/), including [GameOS](https://github.com/PlayingKarrde/gameOS) theme - you can also use them for other  front-ends such as Emulation Station, LaunchBox/BigBox, Attract Mode, or any other project where you want monochrome logos.

The collection includes arcade, console, computer, publisher, category and playlist logos - comprehensive coverage of the usual (and some unusual) emulated systems/platforms. 

There are currently over 600 designs and variations in the collection.

Samples:

Some of the designs are covered by original copyright and many are registered or unregistered trade or service marks of their brand owners. The specific recreations hosted here are works of artistic expression under a fair-use principle, provided as-is for identification purposes, without any claimed affiliation or endorsement from any rights holders. Use them freely in your collections or projects but be aware that there may be restrictions with respect to any commercial use. I ask that you include a link back to this repository if distributing them with your work, in an effort to maintain a growing collection and realize any future edits. I take no responsibility for any issues that may arise from anyone else's use or misuse of these images. 

### Requests

Let me know by opening a new issue if there's anything important missing, you have an idea for an alternate or have any special requests.

### Submissions

Make sure the design is 100% vector-based (SVG, EPS or AI) without any rasterized or bitmap elements - also not a poor automated trace with excessive nodes/anchors. Submit files in one of two ways:
- Open a new issue and post a link to the file(s)
- Fork the repo and add your design(s) to the submissions folder, then issue a pull request.

Please don't submit any bitmap files - PNGs will be generated from the vector files. If you need to submit multi-color vectors, I can create a monochrome version.

### Specifications

**File Sizes:** SVG files are 2 inches wide @ 300dpi and PNG files 600 pixels wide. If you need larger PNG files, download the SVG and resize or increase the DPI, then export a new PNG.

The files have all been passed through an optimizer to reduce their size and maintain compatibility with Pegasus Frontend.

**Filenames:** Files are named in lowercase with words separated by an underscore. In the case of consoles and computers, names start with the manufacturer/brand name, followed by the product/model name, keeping everything grouped together. Example: *nintendo_gameboy_color.svg*. 

Playlist and category-type logos all start with the *playlist_* prefix.

When there are alternative files for one logo, an additional suffix such as *_outline*, *_flat*, *_alt* or other variation is added to the base name.

You may have to rename files or modify platform/playlist names in your theme or configuration files to make them match.

### Background and a Special Request

I originally started working on these logos to shore up missing artwork from [Pegasus Frontend](https://pegasus-frontend.org/), as I'm a big fan and would very much like to see it succeed. While I'm a regular donnor on Patreon, I'm not able to offer very much financially, so it's my hope that I can additionally contribute in other ways, through testing and now by providing more artwork, giving users more options for their collections.

If you value this work, I'd like to make the smallest request. Please visit the [Pegasus Frontend](https://pegasus-frontend.org/) project, try it out on your platform of choice and if you're able, make a small contribution in some way. Consider financial assistance to its author, contributing code to the project or spreading the word and letting your friends or subscribers know about it. 

Don't forget to also check out the [GameOS](https://github.com/PlayingKarrde/gameOS) theme, it provides one of the best and most polished front-end experiences for large game libraries.
